Navigating with xpath

/html/body/div/h1  <-- This will navigate to a title on a webpage

OR 

//h1  <-- This will directly navigate to the title of the webpage

OR

//div/h1 <-- Only selects the h1 tag, which is immediate children of the div tag.

//div//h1 <-- Selects all the h1 tags in under the div tag.

The double // allows to select a tag, without 
going to the parent tag. 

=======================================

Elements are selected by attributes using the @ symbol.

Example: 

//span[@class="title"]

This will select any span tag where the class is "title".

//span[@class="title"]/@id

This will select a specific id attributes where the class is "title".

Finally, 

//span[@class="title"]/text  

The /text means, we are asking for the inner text from the tag.
